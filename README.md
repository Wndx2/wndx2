### Hello, there!

I am wndud--you can call me wnd, wind, wndi, wndu, or whatever the heck you want. I don't really care unless it's not "nerd" or something like that.

Currently working on Swift projects because my teacher said I would enjoy Swift.

You can check my alt `@sleepywndud` for my school projects and assignments! (Te-Puia will be locked until someone finishes their website)

If you have anything for me, DM `wndx2` on Discord!
